      <description>Recently I was clearing out some old movie rips that I had created from VideoCDs and DVDs many years ago. I wanted a quick and dirty way to organise these i.e. get rid of the videos of resolutions lower than 720p (1280x720)&#xA;With LLMs all the rage at the moment, all it took is a few prompts and corrections and in 15 minutes I had this script ready to go -</description>

      <description>Introduction Ever wanted to play chess against an AI? With the OpenAI API, you can! This blog post will show you how to use Python to interface with the OpenAI API, send and receive requests, and even play a game of chess against an AI opponent. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using the FEN representation of the chess board to communicate game states with the API.&#xA;Setting Up Before we start, make sure you have the following:</description>

      <description>Introduction to Pydantic Pydantic is a Python library that provides data validation and settings management, using Python type annotations. It is designed to make it easy to define and validate data models, allowing you to catch errors and handle them gracefully, making your code more robust and easier to maintain.&#xA;Pydantic is particularly useful for handling data that is passed between different parts of a system, such as between a front-end web form and a back-end API, or between different microservices.</description>

      <description>I. Introduction to Docker What is Docker? How does Docker work? Why is Docker useful? What is Docker? Docker is an open-source containerisation platform that allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a single container. This container can then be easily deployed and run on any platform that supports Docker, making it a great tool for building, shipping, and running applications.&#xA;How does Docker work? Docker works by using the host operating system&amp;rsquo;s kernel and automating the creation, deployment, and management of containers.</description>

      <description>NoSQL databases are a type of database that is designed to handle large amounts of data that is distributed across a large number of servers. NoSQL databases are particularly well-suited for handling unstructured data, such as text, images, and videos, and for handling data that is generated by web and mobile applications.&#xA;There are several different types of NoSQL databases, including:&#xA;Document databases: These databases store data in the form of documents, which are similar to JSON objects.</description>

      <description>Levenshtein distance is a measure of the similarity between two strings, calculated as the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into the other. Here is an example of how you can calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings in Go:&#xA;package main import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;math&amp;#34; ) func main() { s1 := &amp;#34;kitten&amp;#34; s2 := &amp;#34;sitting&amp;#34; distance := levenshteinDistance(s1, s2) fmt.Printf(&amp;#34;The Levenshtein distance between %s and %s is %d\n&amp;#34;, s1, s2, distance) } func levenshteinDistance(s1, s2 string) int { // Convert strings to rune slices for Unicode support r1 := []rune(s1) r2 := []rune(s2) // Initialize a two-dimensional matrix with all values set to zero matrix := make([][]int, len(r1)+1) for i := range matrix { matrix[i] = make([]int, len(r2)+1) } // Set the initial values of the first row and column of the matrix for i := 1; i &amp;lt;= len(r1); i++ { matrix[i][0] = i } for j := 1; j &amp;lt;= len(r2); j++ { matrix[0][j] = j } // Calculate the Levenshtein distance using the dynamic programming algorithm for i := 1; i &amp;lt;= len(r1); i++ { for j := 1; j &amp;lt;= len(r2); j++ { cost := 0 if r1[i-1] !</description>

      <description>Go, also known as Golang, is a modern, open-source programming language developed by Google. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and scalable, and it is widely used in a variety of applications, from web servers and cloud services to games and machine learning.&#xA;In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll provide a crash course on Go programming, including its features, syntax, and available keywords. We&amp;rsquo;ll also include some examples to demonstrate how to use these concepts in your own code.</description>

      <description>Overview I was an Android user for a long period of time, right from the Jellybean and Gingerbread days. After almost a decade being with Android I finally moved to iOS, because I was sick of the fragmentation and I wish Android took privacy as seriously as iOS does. One of the most common things I need to do is transfer files across from my iOS device to my Linux laptop.</description>

My name is Karan and I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing code professionally for about 16 years now.&#xA;My programming journey has taken me from Medical Electronics to Simulation to Defence.&#xA;I started dabbling with computers when I was in 7th grade and my parents bought my sister a Pentium 166MMX. This was a single core processor that ran at a 166Mhz! It had 16mb (yes megabytes) of memory and a 2.</description>
