<p>Hi! My name is Karan and I&rsquo;ve been writing code professionally for about 16 years now.</p>

<p>My programming journey has taken me from Medical Electronics to Simulation to Defence.</p>

<p>I started dabbling with computers when I was in 7th grade and my parents bought my sister a Pentium 166MMX.
This was a single core processor that ran at a 166Mhz! It had 16mb (yes megabytes) of memory and a 2.1gb hard drive.</p>

<p>I started playing video games on this computer (Doom / Duke Nukem 3D) and developed an interest
in tweaking the computer (I remember using XTeq X-Setup) and tinkering with batch and ini files.</p>

<p>This slowly transformed into writing small utilities using Visual Basic (which I learned from a book by
Peter Norton). I studied Mechanical Engineering but realised quickly I was passionate about writing
Software and got myself a Bachelors in Computer Science. I did a Masters in Software Engineering
before I started working as a Software Developer.</p>

<p>My current language of choice is <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a></p>

<p>I ♥️  travel and have lived / worked in India, Japan and the US. I now live in Adelaide, Australia with
my wife Snehal.</p>

<p>My other interests include <strong>motorcycles, video games and street photography.</strong></p>

<p>I write about code, technology, photography and anything that catches my interest. I hope you enjoy your
stay here. You can get in touch with me via email at <a href="mailto:karankadam+blog@gmail.com">karankadam+blog@gmail.com</a>.</p>
