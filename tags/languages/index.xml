      <description>Introduction to Pydantic Pydantic is a Python library that provides data validation and settings management, using Python type annotations. It is designed to make it easy to define and validate data models, allowing you to catch errors and handle them gracefully, making your code more robust and easier to maintain.&#xA;Pydantic is particularly useful for handling data that is passed between different parts of a system, such as between a front-end web form and a back-end API, or between different microservices.</description>
