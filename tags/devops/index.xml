      <description>I. Introduction to Docker What is Docker? How does Docker work? Why is Docker useful? What is Docker? Docker is an open-source containerisation platform that allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a single container. This container can then be easily deployed and run on any platform that supports Docker, making it a great tool for building, shipping, and running applications.
How does Docker work? Docker works by using the host operating system&amp;rsquo;s kernel and automating the creation, deployment, and management of containers.</description>
